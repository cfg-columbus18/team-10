## Main Objective

We first identified that the main need that we needed to meet was that many groups of people who are interested in learning more about the process of sponsoring refugees do not have a reliable way of getting in touch with more experienced sponsors.

## 
We will be making several different areas, such as matching and FAQ.

## Difficulty areas
1. Creating an effective pairing algorithm between sponsors and other sponsors.
2. Designing the website layout to accomodate people with different backgrounds.
3. Balancing being able to ask mentors questions without mentors being burned out from question overloads.
